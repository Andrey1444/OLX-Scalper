# OLX-Scalper
## Features
 - Checks for offers matching your criteria every 5 minutes and notifies you when new offers are found
 - Filters a keyword and the price boundaries manually, because OLX likes to put irrelevant results on your search
 - Keeps track of found offers, so only new offers are shown
